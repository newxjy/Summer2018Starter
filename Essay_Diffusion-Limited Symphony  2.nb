\tSurrounded by highly talented and astute scientists, I was apprehended by \
my profound ignorance of the natural world, and was awed at the powerful \
insights from science about humanity. Trying ironically hard to add a \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]science-y\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] touch to my \
thoughts, I buried myself in introductory books on math, biology and computer \
science for several sleepless nights, redrafting my computational essay \
prompt over and over again. I ultimately settled down on the complex idea of \
applying social network theory to predict the probability of a newly \
introduced mutant generating a lineage that takes over the whole population. \
I explained my ideas to Kyle with the graphed structure of population that I \
was going to analyze, thinking somewhat self-satisfactorily that this essay \
would perfectly serve as a building block for my final project. 
\t\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s forget about this essay for \
now and start with something simple,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Kyle put away my \
computer and winkled at me. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How about creating a news \
map that compares news sources horizontally and vertically to generate more \
accurate information?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I replied. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Still too complicated,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said \
Kyle. As soon as convoluted thoughts rushed in my mind to fill any void, Kyle \
wittily negated all of them and pushed me to think further in a simpler \
manner. This process of puzzlement and discovery had brought about animated \
conversation, effectively removing layers and layers of bookish concepts that \
deterred me from sensing the world as it is. All of a sudden, words such as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nature,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]flower,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wind,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]water\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] from Kyle created a \
ripple effect in my mind that surprisingly built associations between the \
growth pattern of a snowflake with music passages from a symphony. 
\tTo turn this idea into reality, I took Kyle\[CloseCurlyQuote]s advice on \
self-studying the diffusion-limited aggregation and audio processing with \
Mathematica. The more I played around with relevant codes, the more I \
realized the power of simple ideas in generating sophisticated knowledge, as \
well as that of informal discussion in bringing about fresh insights.\

\tA chemist would typically explain the formation of a snowflake as follows:
\t\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ultimately, it is the temperature at which a crystal \
forms \[LongDash] and to a lesser extent the humidity of the air \[LongDash] \
that determines the basic shape of the ice crystal. Thus, we see long \
needle-like crystals at 23 degrees F and very flat plate-like crystals at 5 \
degrees F. \[NonBreakingSpace]
\tThe intricate shape of a single arm of the snowflake is determined by the \
atmospheric conditions experienced by entire ice crystal as it falls. A \
crystal might begin to grow arms in one manner, and then minutes or even \
seconds later, slight changes in the surrounding temperature or humidity \
causes the crystal to grow in another way. Although the six-sided shape is \
always maintained, the ice crystal (and its six arms) may branch off in new \
directions.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]
\tRather than relying on the highly complex rules for growth in the \
explanation, this diffusion-limited model follows extremely simple rules to \
achieve similar results with astounding diversity and visual effects. While \
not fully capturing all factors, such as humidity and temperature, that \
influence the formation of a snowflake in the real world, this model embodies \
nevertheless the fundamental principles underlying the growth of a natural \
object. 
\tSimilarly, a music note can be simply depicted as vibrations of mechanical \
systems measured in hertz (HZ). As is well-known, these fixed frequencies are \
mathematically related to each other, and can be easily transcribed into \
computational language. Considering the interconnectedness among various \
things in this world, this coding experience prompted me to think further \
about whether all natural phenomena, or even human feelings and behaviors, \
are explainable by strikingly simple underlying rules. \

\tThis diffusion-limited model beautifully illustrates that an original seed \
when combined with even a few simple rules can result in apparent randomness. \
This tumultuous situation is reinforced by the intensifying noise in the \
background. Following the question in the second section of this essay, I am \
wondering if it is possible that all randomness results from the application \
of a minimal number of uncomplicated rules? If so, would keeping the \
underlying rules and leaving out superfluous factors in real world \
circumstances (i.e. humidity) justify in turn the power of computational \
language in approximating the real world? Since for two snowflakes to be \
exactly identical, identical conditions in nature are required, which is \
basically impossible, thus the futility of involving those detailed factors \
into the model considering the random results.\
